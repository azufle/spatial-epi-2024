  intro:
    text: "The 5th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Spatial Computing for Epidemiology (SpatialEpi’24) focuses on all aspects of modeling, simulating, mining, and understanding the spatial processes and patterns of the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. This cross-disciplinary workshop is a forum to bring together researchers in the SIGSPATIAL community as well as researchers in epidemiology. Also, this workshop is of interest to everyone who works with infectious disease data and models (not necessarily COVID19). In addition to paper presentations, this workshop will feature invited speakers keynotes from experts across the SIGSPATIAL community and epidemiology."

  cfp:
    text: "The workshop seeks high-quality full (8-10 pages) and short (4 pages) papers that have not been published in other academic outlets and are not concurrently under peer review. Once accepted, at least one author is required to register for the workshop and the ACM SIGSPATIAL conference, as well as attend the workshop to present the accepted work which will then appear in the ACM Digital Library. As SpatialEpi papers appear in the ACM SIGSPATIAL proceedings we follow the same submission process. Submission details can be found at https://sigspatial2024.sigspatial.org/camera-ready/. Following the main-conference, we also allow full papers to have a two-page appendix beyond the ten pages limit."

         bio: "Dr. Max Lau is Assistant Professor at Emory University, Rollins School of Public Health in the Biostatistics Department and is jointly appointed with the Epidemiology Department.  He earned his MPhil in Public Health and statistical modeling of infectious diseases at the University of Hongkong (2011).  He obtained his Ph.D. in statistical modeling of infectious diseases at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh (2015).  He completed his post doc work at Princeton University (2018) and began his career at Emory University in 2019.  He has developed new Bayesian methods and modelling techniques for disease data and data integration and designs and teaches graduate level machine learning and modeling classes."
